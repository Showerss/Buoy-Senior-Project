Solar-Powered IoT Water-Quality Buoy


Welcome to the Solar-Powered IoT Water-Quality Buoy project! This repository contains embedded C firmware for STM32, a Python-based GUI dashboard, and configuration/scripts for deploying a self-sustaining buoy that monitors and reports water quality in real time.

üîç Overview
A floating station that:

Monitors pH, turbidity, dissolved oxygen (DO), conductivity, and temperature

Runs on a solar-powered LiFePO‚ÇÑ battery for multi-month deployments

Communicates sensor data via LoRaWAN (with NB-IoT fallback)

Stores data in a time-series database

Provides a desktop GUI (Tkinter-based) for visualization and alerts

üöÄ Features
Embedded Firmware in C for STM32L4: sensor polling, calibration, power cycling, LoRa uplinks

Python GUI Dashboard: real-time data plots (matplotlib), sensor health indicators, alert system with offline caching (SQLite)

Modular Architecture: clear separation of SensorModule, PowerManager, CommModule, and main loop

Extensive Documentation: design diagrams, architecture breakdowns, and UML specs

üõ†Ô∏è Getting Started
Clone the repo

bash
Copy
Edit
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/water-quality-buoy.git
cd water-quality-buoy
Set up your environment

Firmware: install STM32CubeIDE or the arm-none-eabi toolchain

GUI: Python 3.8+ with Tkinter, pip install -r gui/requirements.txt

Build & Deploy

Firmware:

Open the STM32Cube project in /firmware/

Build and flash via ST-Link to STM32L4 MCU

GUI:

bash
Copy
Edit
cd gui
python main.py
Connect LoRa Gateway & Database
Configure LoRa keys in firmware/config.h and ensure your database backend (e.g., InfluxDB) is reachable for downstream ingestion.

üîß Configuration
Firmware: firmware/config.h ‚Äì set read intervals, thresholds, and sensor calibration constants

GUI: gui/settings.ini ‚Äì define API endpoint, alert thresholds, and local cache preferences
