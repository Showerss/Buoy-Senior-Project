# Solar-Powered IoT Water-Quality Buoy

> A solar-powered, self-sustaining buoy that continuously measures water quality (pH, turbidity, dissolved oxygen, conductivity, temperature) and transmits data via LoRaWAN to your dashboard.

## üåä Introduction

Water quality monitoring is vital for environmental conservation, research, and public health. Traditional monitoring methods are often labor-intensive and expensive, especially in remote or hard-to-reach locations. This project introduces a **solar-powered IoT buoy** designed to autonomously collect and transmit real-time water quality data. By leveraging renewable energy, robust sensors, and long-range communication (LoRaWAN), our buoy provides a scalable, low-maintenance solution for continuous aquatic monitoring.

Whether you‚Äôre a researcher, educator, or community organizer, this open-source project can help you deploy affordable water-quality monitoring stations in lakes, rivers, and reservoirs.

## üöÄ Quick Start

1. **Clone the repo**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/water-quality-buoy.git
   cd water-quality-buoy
   ```
2. **Firmware Setup (STM32)**
   - Open `/firmware/` in STM32CubeIDE or install `arm-none-eabi` toolchain.
   - Configure `config.h` (sampling interval, calibration).
   - Build & flash via ST‚ÄëLink.
3. **Backend Setup (Go)**
   ```bash
   cd backend
   go mod tidy
   go build -o buoy-server
   ./buoy-server --config config.yaml
   ```
4. **GUI Dashboard (Python)**
   ```bash
   cd gui
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   python main.py
   ```
5. **Connect LoRa Gateway**
   - Configure LoRaWAN keys in `backend/config.yaml`
   - Ensure MQTT broker endpoint is reachable.
